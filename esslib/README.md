The ESS Library for Google Glass
================================

 A collection of boiler-plate code that I found useful.
 
## Installation
 
run the build and installation (i.e. have your Glass connected and ADB enabled):
  
      ./gradlew installDebug
   
After the installation is completed, run the demos with "ok glass, show me a demo..."
