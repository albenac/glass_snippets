The ESS Library for Google Glass
================================

 This repository contains a number of smallish code usable for Google Glass.
 It is intened to serve as boiler plate code for often used features and for those missing from the gdk.
 
## Installation
 
run the build and installation (i.e. have your Glass connected and ADB enabled):
  
      ./gradlew installDebug
   
After the installation is completed, run the demos with "ok glass, show me a demo..."

 
 Be warned most of this stuff requires a decompiled version of the Glassvoice.apk (included in the repository), so most probably these samples will break with every new xe-firmware release until the Glassvoice.jar file in this repo will be updated.
 It currently contains these functionalities:

## Hello World

 A basic project setup, showing how to use a voice trigger and displaying a simple message.

## Voice Menu

 Another implementation of the Contextual Voice commands menu, phrases can be freely chosen.
 Displaying the menu is optional.

## Head List View

 This sample is included in the voice menu demo.
 Moving your head it allows to scroll a list, like the "ok, glass" menu.
 Implementation can be found in the HeadListView.java file.

## Time Lapse Recorder

 A Camera service that allows to record normal video and time lapses in background.
 Recording with a framerate > 25fps automatically turns on audio recording.
 The preview is displayed constantly, at a specified location with a specified size.

## Head Image View

 Use the AHRS of Glass to watch parts of a zoomed in Image.
 Similar to the Google Glass Team Easter Egg.
